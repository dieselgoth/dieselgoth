My [most recommended list](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/skids/pl.u-KVXB0d3uV4xjEy) of driving sounds is the result of tens of thousands of miles of spirited driving throughout rural Missouri and in Gran Turismo. It is valuable. I'm very proud of it. [The playlist I recently insisted upon](https://extratone.com/you-will-listen-to-this-playlist) via Extratone is also quite ideal for fast driving.
